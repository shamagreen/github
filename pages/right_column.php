<p>Rawal Village is the new name that food lovers are talking about, attracting people from all over the Midlands region and further afield to the heart of Birmingham's renowned Balti Triangle.

We offer a very extensive range of traditional high quality food to cater for today's sophisticated taste buds. It is an experience that you will never forget.</p>
<p>Our restaurant is a unique dining experience with its distinguished, original characteristics preserved both inside and outside restaurant, creating an attractive, comfortable eating venue for all Stratford-Upon-Avon's local residents and individuals visiting for short breaks. 
We aim to pride ourselves in providing an attentive, polite and friendly service for all of our customers, as well as a superb, fine dining restaurant for visitors of all ages- always ensuring you are welcomed and well-looked after so you are able to relax and fully appreciate the Shakespearean, homely feel and decoration, which (I'm sure you will agree-) is unlike any other Indian Tandoori restaurants you may have been to before!
